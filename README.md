# Basic Ml Models coded from scratch

## k-means clustering
- takes k elements at start and then clusters the rest according to the shortest distance
- adjusts the cluster means after 1st iteration
- each iteration puts the points into the cluster with closest means
- iterations continue until no changes are made
